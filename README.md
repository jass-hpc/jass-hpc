# Jaspreet Singh

Systems Architect specializing in **GPU & HPC automation platforms**, hybrid cloud HPC, and large-scale infrastructure.

## What I do
- Architect and operate **GPU/HPC clusters** using IBM Spectrum LSF and Slurm
- Design **automation-first infrastructure** (bare metal, Ansible, CI/CD integration)
- Build **hybrid HPC environments**, including AWS-based burst and Spot compute
- Focus on **performance, reliability, and cost efficiency** at scale

## Areas of experience
- GPU & HPC Infrastructure Architecture
- LSF / Slurm Scheduling & Resource Governance
- Bare-metal provisioning (PXE, iPXE, Kickstart)
- Infrastructure automation (Ansible, Bash)
- Hybrid HPC on AWS (EC2, Spot, Auto Scaling)
- Monitoring & observability (Prometheus, Datadog)
- High-performance storage (Weka, Pure Storage)

## About this GitHub
Most of my professional work has been on internal and proprietary systems.
This GitHub contains **reference implementations, examples, and documentation**
that reflect real-world HPC and infrastructure patterns.
